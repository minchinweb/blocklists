# Personal DNS Blacklist & Whitelist

Pi-Hole is an amazing project, but it needs blocklists to be effective. Every
so other, I come across a domain name I'd like to block, and so this is the
collection of those. It is not meant to be comprehensive; use it to supplement
your other blocklists.

I aim mostly to block ads, but aire on the side of keeping things functional,
while some of the other lists are a little aggressive or slow to update. Thus
the whitelist.
